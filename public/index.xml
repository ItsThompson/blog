      <description>Ranked Based Matchmaking Ranked based matchmaking is a system that matches players of similar skill levels together based on a player&amp;rsquo;s rank defined by their performance in matches, ideally creating an competitive environment where players feel like they are challenged but not overwhelmed. This system is used in many competitive games: Valorant, League of Legends, Overwatch, and Counter-Strike.
The objective of these ranking algorithms is to take all the datapoints from the game such as match outcome, round differencial, individual performance and create a score that represents the player&amp;rsquo;s skill level.</description>

      <description>Upbringing Upbringing: the treatment and instruction received by a child from its parents throughout its childhood.
Coming from a privileged, international childhood and meeting many people from similar backgrounds, I have always had many safety nets growing up. My family and families that I was in contact with I did not have the financial stress that 23% of UK families and carers have (Feeling the Strain - The Children&amp;rsquo;s Society). Now that I am in university, by working a part-time job and escaping the &amp;lsquo;bubble&amp;rsquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve been inside of, I would like to reflect on how upbringing and mindset effects long-term life trajectory.</description>
